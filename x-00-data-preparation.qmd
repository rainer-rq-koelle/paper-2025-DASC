This paper summarises the data preparatory action and methods developed for the paper.

## Trajectory

We tap into OSN data. A trajectory is a series of time-ordered 4D positions, i.e., TIME, LAT, LON, ALT, associated with a FLTID, and some complementary data (e.g. first derivates, special codes)

Single Flight: Represent each trajectory as a 4D function

$$flight_i \rightarrow T_i(t)$$

$$
T_i(t)=(x_i(t),y_i(t),z_i(t),t), 
t \in [t_{start i},t_{end_i}]
$$

A **trajectory set** comprises multiple flights, a collection of multiple trajectories
$$\{T_1(t), T_2(t), ... ,T_N(t)\}$$
